# Henry Samuel - Data Science Portfolio

## About
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB), where I developed a deep interest in the intersection of engineering and technology. With a robust background in mechanical systems, I've transitioned into the realm of data science and artificial intelligence, bringing a unique perspective to complex data challenges. Currently, I am honing my skills as an AI Engineer, backed by my recent certification in the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate.

During my career, I've applied my technical skills in developing Python codes for automating data processes. My projects include developing Python codes that leverage data to drive decision-making and innovation and using Tableau to visualize pandemic trends globallyâ€”tools that have been essential in my data-driven journey.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.


### Forming UCL 22/23 XI of the Tournament Analysis
**Code** : [Football Analytics Project: Forming XI of the UCL 22/23](https://github.com/nrysam/UCL22_23/edit/main/README.md)

**Description** : The project focused on analyzing the dataset of football players played in UCL Season 2022/2023. The dataset included statistics from various metrics, such as Goals, Assists, Expected Goals, Key Passes, Total Tackles, Saves and other relevant metrics. It leverages advanced statistical methods and data visualization techniques to evaluate and select the top performers. The analysis is segmented into five Python scripts, each serving a distinct purpose towards the final selection of players.

**Skills** : Data Cleansing, Data Preprocessing, Advanced Data Visualization, Statistical Analysis, Predictive Modeling

**Technology** : Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Bokeh, Scikit-learn

**Result** : Delivers interactive visualizations such as heatmaps, bar plots, radar charts, and violin plots, aiding in the insightful comparison and selection of top performers. The final output includes a dynamically generated "Best XI" team, showcasing the capabilities of data-driven decision-making in sports analytics.
